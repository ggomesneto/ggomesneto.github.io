                  <h2 class="chapter-title">The Software Engineer Saga</h2>
                  <p>
                    VS Code was opened and a new document was created. "I am almost finishing the course" Geraldo gleefully thought to himself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The "course" that referenced was <strong><a href='https://www.springboard.com/courses/software-engineering-career-track/' target='_blank'>Springboard's Software Engineering Bootcamp.</a></strong> A few months had passed since Geraldo decided to start the Bootcamp, in an attempt to widen his knowledge to try to change careers. From the first day working in the Oil and Gas Industry, an inner voice told him that he could do better. After so many years, it was time to listen to it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Coding was something brand new for him, but he was already used to having to learn something from scratch. At the current age of 33, he had already taken classes on a wide range of subjects, from 3D Printing to Real-Time Geological Interpretation and Processing. Learning was always easy for him. He would give the credit for that to an excellent education while young, living in Brazil.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Bootcamp was pretty intensive since he was doing it while working 13 hours a day in an offshore oil rig. But he knew it was going to be hard before he signed the contract. And he decided to push himself the most he could.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the first project, a <sup>AWESOME!</sup><strong><strike>silly</strike><a href='#' id='memoryGame'> memory game</a></strong>, he realized what was missing from all those years working in the oilfield: The feeling of pride and accomplishment from something he made from scratch. That was the energy-booster necessary to make him dive deep into coding. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After each week learning new things, from JavaScript or Python to JQuery, Flask, or ReactJS, his projects were getting more interesting. He learned how to handle API requests and created a <strong><a href='#'id='jeopardyGame'>Jeopardy</a></strong> and a <strong><a href='#' id='connect'>Connect-4 Game</a></strong> after learning about Object-Oriented Programming. Geraldo also deployed a <a href='HackOrSnooze/index.html' target='_blank'><Strong>Clone of Hacker News</Strong></a>, using their public API.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    His first big project, a <strong><mark class=orange"><a href='#'target='_blank'>Gaming Library</a></mark></strong> covered all his knowledge. Using Flask, SQLAlchemy, JQuery, and some other technologies, he was able to complete something that he was really proud of.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    One thing that amazed Geraldo about coding was that he was feeling part of something, not like he ever felt before. Every time he would search for some help online and find it on Github or StackOverflow he would realize he was not alone in his doubts and that he had friends everywhere willing to assist him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Geraldo was making quite the effort into fine-tuning his skills, but he knew that was not enough. He needed to introduce himself to the tech world. So to <strong><a href='https://linkedin.com/in/ggomesneto'target='_blank'>LinkedIn</a></strong> he went and started to network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  It was difficult for him not to feel envy of the people with years of experience ahead of him, but he knew that <i>‘Everybody has to start somewhere’</i>, and his somewhere was just happening. Geraldo decided to learn from the experienced people what was necessary to succeed. His first certification, the <strong><a href='https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/c166c324-fad7-449d-a48d-763dd73a4944/linked_in'target='_blank'>AWS Cloud Practitioner</a></strong>, was taken during that time.
                </p>
                  <p>
                    One day, Geraldo received a message from his wife with a picture of a kid taken of a newspaper from 20 years ago. It was HIM giving an <a href='#' id='journalBttn'><strong>interview</strong></a> about what he wanted to be when he grew up. To his surprise, his answer was: <strong> <mark class="green">A WRITER</mark></strong>. After that day, Geraldo realized why becoming a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> felt so great: During his entire life he was looking for his way of writing. And he finally found it. <strong><mark class="green">IT WAS CODING</mark></strong>.
